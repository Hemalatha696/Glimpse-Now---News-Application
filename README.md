Glimpse Now is a Python-based news application that delivers concise, real-time news updates directly to the userâ€™s desktop. With an easy-to-use interface, users can quickly browse summarized news articles and opt to read the full article in their default web browser.

## Features
- **Real-Time News Updates**: Fetches the latest news articles using a public news API.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple GUI built with Tkinter for seamless interaction.

- **Read More Option**: Directs users to the full article for comprehensive reading.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/Glimpse-Now.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Glimpse-Now
   ```
3. **Install required dependencies**:
   Ensure that you have `Pillow`, `requests`, and `Tkinter` installed.
   ```bash

   ```

## Usage

```
